Web Scraping Based AI Chatbot (Console Application)

A Python-based console chatbot that scrapes website content and uses OpenAI GPT models to answer user queries strictly based on the scraped data.

This project demonstrates the integration of web scraping, prompt engineering, and LLM-based conversational AI.

📌 Features

🌐 Scrapes live website content using requests and BeautifulSoup

🧹 Cleans and preprocesses HTML data automatically

🤖 Initializes ChatGPT with website context

💬 Interactive console-based chatbot

🔒 Answers only from website data (no hallucination)

🚫 Gracefully handles errors (invalid URLs, API issues, etc.)

⚡ Limits content size to avoid token overflow

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python 3.8+

Libraries Used:

▶️ How to Run the Project
python chatbot.py

Console Flow:

Enter a website URL (or press Enter for default)

Website content is scraped and analyzed

Chatbot starts interaction

Ask questions related to the website

💡 Example Interaction
Enter the website URL to scrape:
https://botpenguin.com/

Jarvis: Hi! I have analyzed the website.
Ask me anything about it!

You: What services does this website provide?
Jarvis: The website offers AI chatbot solutions for businesses...

🧠 How It Works (Architecture)
Step-by-Step Flow:

Website Scraping

Fetches HTML using requests

Parses content using BeautifulSoup

Removes scripts, styles, headers, footers

Text Cleaning

Removes extra spaces

Limits text to 3000 words

Context Injection

Website content is added as a system message

ChatGPT is instructed to answer strictly from this data

Conversation Loop

User questions are appended to chat history

GPT generates contextual responses

🚧 Limitations

Cannot answer questions outside website content

Console-based UI (no web UI)

Depends on website accessibility

Token limits for very large websites

🚀 Future Enhancements

🌍 Web UI using Gradio / Streamlit

📄 PDF & multiple page scraping

🔍 Semantic search using embeddings

🧠 Vector database (FAISS / Pinecone)

🗂️ Multi-website support

🔐 Environment-based API key handling

🎓 Use Cases
